This repository contains the code and documentation for a Google Colab lab assignment implementing YOLOv11 for real-time object detection using the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset. The project covers environment setup, dataset acquisition and preprocessing via Roboflow, model training, inference, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing and evaluating a YOLOv11 model for object detection. The project is executed on Google Colab, where the required libraries (Roboflow, Ultralytics, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc.) are installed. The Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset is acquired via Roboflow, preprocessed, and then used to train a YOLOv11 model. Finally, the trained model is tested on unseen data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

## 📂 Dataset
### Dataset Acquisition
- **Source:** The Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset available on Roboflow.
- **Acquisition Method:**
  - The dataset is downloaded using the Roboflow API.
  - Example:
    ```python
    !pip install roboflow
    from roboflow import Roboflow
    rf = Roboflow(api_key="jBRsMtfCa6QP67xjDuwU")
    project = rf.workspace("roboflow-58fyf").project("rock-paper-scissors")
    version = project.version(14)
    dataset = version.download("yolov11")
    ```

### Dataset Structure and Characteristics
#### Structure:
After downloading, the dataset is organized in a YOLO-friendly format with separate directories for training, validation, and testing:
- `train/`: Contains training images and YOLO-format labels.
- `valid/`: Contains validation images and labels.
- `test/`: Contains test images for inference.

#### Characteristics:
- **Classes:** Rock, Paper, Scissors.
- **Annotations:** Bounding boxes with class labels in YOLO format (normalized coordinates).
- **Preprocessing:** Minimal preprocessing is required; however, verifying image sizes and annotations is crucial for the training pipeline.

## ⚙️ Methodology
### Environment Setup and Installation
- Set up your Google Colab environment by installing required libraries such as Roboflow, Ultralytics, PyTorch, and OpenCV.
- Verify that the environment is correctly configured for YOLOv11.

### Dataset Preparation & Preprocessing
- Download the Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset in YOLOv11 format using the Roboflow API.
- Verify the dataset structure (`train`, `valid`, `test`) and ensure the annotations are correctly formatted.
- Conduct a data quality check by reviewing sample images and labels.

### Model Training
- Initialize the YOLOv11 model using the pre-trained weights (e.g., `yolo11n.pt`).
- Configure training parameters, including the number of epochs (e.g., 100), batch size, learning rate, and input image size.
- Monitor training progress via loss, mAP, precision, and recall.
- Save the best-performing model based on validation metrics.

### Model Inference and Evaluation
- Load the best saved model weights.
- Run inference on unseen test images and save the results.
- Visualize the inference outputs (bounding boxes and confidence scores) using tools like matplotlib or PIL.
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as mAP (at IoU 0.5 and 0.5–0.95), precision, recall, and F1 score.
